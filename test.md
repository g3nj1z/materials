|  General Headers |  Request Headers |  Response Headers |
|---|---|---|
| `Connection` allows the receiving end to know whether or not the TCP connection should be closed after the HTTP transmission is complete, depending on the value | `Accept` notifies the server what sorts of content the client is ready to accept, such as image types, and office document formats.  | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` whether or not the resource can be obtained via cross-domain Ajax requests.  |
|  `Content-Encoding` in the message body is encoded using a specific format, such as gzip, which some apps employ to speed up respond transmission. | `Accept-Encoding` shows what kind of content encoding the client is willing to accept on the server's end. |  `Cache-Control` enables the browser to implement caching policies (for example, no-cache). |
| `Content-Length` defines the size of the message body in bytes (except in the case of responses to HEAD requests, when it indicates the length of the body in the response to the corresponding GET request).  | `Authorization` sends the server credentials for one of the HTTP authentication types that are already built-in.  | `ETag` specifies an entity tag. Clients can use this identifier in the If-None-Match header of future requests for the same resource to tell the server which version of the resource is already in the browser's cache.  |
| `Content-Type` tells what kind of information is in the message body, like text/html for HTML documents.  |  `Cookie` sends the server the cookies that the server has already given out. |  `Expires` gives the browser an idea of how long the message body's content will be valid in its current form. Until then, the cached copy of this resource can be used by the browser. |
| `Transfer-Encoding` specifies Encoding that was applied to the message's body for HTTP transfer is listed here. When chunked encoding is utilised, this is the most common way to describe it.  | `Host` provides the hostname that appeared in the URL that was requested.  | `Location` is used in redirection responses (status codes starting with 3) to identify the target of the redirect.  |
|  | `If-Modified-Since` identifies the time at which the browser was last updated with the requested file. The server may instruct the client to use its cached copy if the resource has not changed since that time, sending a response with status code 304. | `Pragma` passes caching directives to the browser (for example, `no-cache`). |  
|  | `If-None-Match` indicates the message body's entity tag, which serves as an identification for the message content. When a user requests a resource, the browser sends the server the entity tag that was issued with it when it was last received. Using the entity tag, the server may tell if a particular browser is allowed to make use of the server's cached copy of the resource. | `Server` provides information about the web server software being used. | 
|  | `Origin` can be used in cross-domain Ajax requests in order to identify where a request originated from | `Set-Cookie` gives the browser a cookie that it can use to make future requests to the server. | 
|  | `Referer` the URL from which the current request came provides the URL that came from. | `WWW-Authenticate` is used in responses with a 401 status code to offer information about the types of authentication supported by the server. | 
|  | `User-Agent` details the browser or other client software that made the request and the associated parameters. | `X-Frame-Options` specifies whether or not the current response can be loaded within a browser frame and how it should be done.indicates whether and how the current response may be loaded within a browser  frame |
